# Photo Setup Guide

## ‚úÖ Current Status
Your portfolio now shows **professional placeholder photos** in both Hero and About sections!

## üñºÔ∏è To Add Your Real Photo

### Method 1: Local File Upload
1. **Save your professional photo** as `src/assets/profile-photo.jpg`
   - Recommended: 400x400px minimum, square format
   - High quality JPG or PNG

2. **Update both components** by replacing the current Unsplash URLs:

   **In Hero.jsx** (line ~53):
   ```jsx
   src="/src/assets/profile-photo.jpg"
   ```

   **In About.jsx** (line ~60):
   ```jsx  
   src="/src/assets/profile-photo.jpg"
   ```

### Method 2: Use Your Own Image URL
Upload your photo to any image hosting service and replace:

```jsx
src="https://your-image-url-here.jpg"
```
